/*
 ‚úÖ Conceptual Summary of Java LLD Architecture

1Ô∏è‚É£ Object Layer (Model / POJO)
- Represents real-world entities (e.g., Employee, Student, etc.)
- Encapsulates data using private fields and provides access via getters/setters
- Acts as the basic data unit of the system

2Ô∏è‚É£ Service Layer (Business Logic)
- Contains logic to create, read, update, and delete objects
- Acts as a bridge between the object layer and the controlling logic
- Keeps logic reusable, testable, and separated from user interaction

3Ô∏è‚É£ Driver Layer (main() / Execution Layer)
- Acts as the entry point of the application
- Calls the service layer to perform operations on model objects
- Simulates the actual flow of the system

üß† Key Principle: Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a specific role, making the system modular, clean, and maintainable.
