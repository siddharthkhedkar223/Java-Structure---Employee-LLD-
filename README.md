✅ Conceptual Summary of Java LLD Architecture
🔹 1️⃣ Object Layer (Model / POJO)
Represents real-world entities (e.g., Employee, Student, etc.)

Encapsulates data using private fields and provides access via getters/setters

Acts as the basic data unit of the system

🔹 2️⃣ Service Layer (Business Logic)
Contains logic to create, read, update, and delete objects

Serves as a bridge between the object layer and the controlling logic

Keeps logic reusable, testable, and separated from user interaction

🔹 3️⃣ Driver Layer (main() / Execution Layer)
Acts as the entry point of the application

Calls the service layer to perform operations on model objects

Simulates the actual flow of the system

🧠 Key Principle: Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a specific role, making the system modular, clean, and maintainable.
