# 🧩 Java Low-Level Design (LLD) Architecture - Conceptual Summary

This repository demonstrates a basic **LLD (Low-Level Design)** structure in Java using standard design principles.

---

## ✅ Architecture Overview

### 🔹 1️⃣ Object Layer (Model / POJO)
- Represents real-world entities (e.g., `Employee`, `Student`, etc.)
- Encapsulates data using **private fields**
- Provides access through **getters** and **setters**
- Acts as the **basic data unit** of the system

### 🔹 2️⃣ Service Layer (Business Logic)
- Contains the logic to **create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)** objects
- Acts as a **bridge** between the model layer and the driver layer
- Keeps business logic **reusable**, **testable**, and **independent of user interaction**

### 🔹 3️⃣ Driver Layer (Execution / main method)
- Serves as the **entry point** of the application
- Calls service layer methods to perform operations on model objects
- Simulates the actual flow of the application

## 🧠 Key Design Principle: Separation of Concerns

> Each layer has a specific responsibility, making the codebase:
> - Modular 🧱  
> - Maintainable 🔧  
> - Scalable 📈  
> - Easy to test 🧪

## 📁 Folder Structure (Example)

```
Employee_LLD/
├── model/
│ └── Employee.java
├── service/
│ └── EmployeeService.java
├── driver/
│ └── Main.java
└── README.md
```

## 📌 Summary

This LLD approach helps build a clean and maintainable Java application by organizing responsibilities into layers. It’s a great practice for building scalable and testable systems.
